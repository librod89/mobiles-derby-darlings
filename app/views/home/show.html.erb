    <p class="join">
      Mobile's Derby Darlings is our name, and women's flat track roller derby is the name of our game--we play it with style!   Athleticism and community outreach is our thing, so if getting fit, playing hard, and giving back to your city sounds like a grand old time, come try us on for size!
      <br /><br />
      Want to be a 'Darling', but not interested in skating?  We have room for you too!  Our associate membership program gets you involved, minus the sweat!  Our sport requires a lot of help from awesome people just like you, so don't hesitate to ask how to get in on the action without getting out on the track.
      <br /><br />
      We are also looking to increase the might of our blossoming TEAM ZEBRA!  That means you, boys - the Derby Darlings need YOU (and your friends).  Referees and volunteers make the derby world go 'round. You must be 18+ to skate, 19+ to play the game!
      <br /><br />
      Whether you're a seasoned pro or a complete newbie, you are welcome to come to any of our open skate sessions held year round on Mondays and Thursdays 7pm - 9pm at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/5672+Three+Notch+Rd,+Mobile,+AL+36619/@30.5896733,-88.1767886,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x889bb4b6cc00d751:0x8af5f6de0ad2d742!8m2!3d30.5896733!4d-88.1745946" target="_blank">Dreamland Skate Center</a>. 
      Make sure to wear comfortable athletic clothing and bring any gear that you own: skates, helmet, knee pads, elbow pads, wrist guards, and mouth guard.
      If you don't have any gear, no worries! We will let you borrow all the gear you need to get you skating safely. Your first two open skate sessions are free so what are you waiting for?
      <br /><br />
      Contact us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mobilesderbydarlings/">Facebook</a> to let us know you're coming!

    <h1 class="decorated"><span>About Us</span></h1>
    <p class="about">
      Mobile Derby Darlings was founded in 2011 and stands as Mobile's only all-female, skater-operated roller derby team committed to athleticism and sportswomanship, raising awareness about and furthering the sport of roller derby.
      The team is composed of strong, diverse, and independent women from different locations and of varying skill levels.
      <br />
      MDD is committed to developing athletes, promoting the physical and mental strength and independent spirit of amateur female athletes, while competing in interleague bouting. In doing such, they believe all people are equal and important and should be treated as such.
      The skaters work tirelessly, on the track and off, to represent the team, whether at home or on the road. They demonstrate positive role models for women and act as contributing members of their local community, volunteering and fundraising, while displaying values such as 
      empowerment, friendship, discipline, pride, dedication, a "for the skater, by the skater" philosophy and competing at the highest levels of gameplay throughout the league.
      <br /><br />
